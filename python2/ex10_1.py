while True:
    for i in ["/","-","|","\\","|"]:
        print "%s\r" % i,
        
 # Now what this code does is pretty simple. Works as an infinte loop and then it gives us the feeling that / is turning around 360 degress. Its a funny code no doubt about it. But there are so many beautiful pieces of codes inside it. The lines must be indented to work. then we have \r so as to show us the ever changing value of "i" with each iteration. \r basically moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. It is known as CR ( carriage - return )
 
 #If we remove it, it will simply print every value that it has to show and keep printing. Now if we remove comma and keep the statement intact , it will keep printing every value of i for each iteration in the next line.
