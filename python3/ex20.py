#it found so far. The file f is responsible for maintaining the current position
#in the file after each readline() call, so that it will keep reading each line.

#The readline() function returns the \n thatâ€™s
#in the file at the end of that line. Add a end = "" at the end of your print
#function calls to avoid adding double \n to every line.
