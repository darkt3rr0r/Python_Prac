#A fucntion can return something. The use of return statement
#What happened here ?
#1. Our function is called with two arguments: a and b .
#2.We print out what our function is doing, in this case ‚ÄùADDING."
#3.Then we tell Python to do something kind of backward: we return the addition of a + b
#4.Python adds the two numbers. Then when the function ends, any line that runs it will be able to
#assign this a + b result to a variable.
