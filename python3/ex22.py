print("""There is nothing much to say here. We have learnt a lot of things.
Now here is the thing we should do. You should go back and revise and what you
learnt and then try to make a list of all things that you were not able to
understand. Go and clear your doubts using the internet or ask your trainer.
We have a very long way to go and try a lot of new things. We have gotten the
hang of the language, now it is time to explore some things which python offers.
GO slow, don't try to run / rush throug things. GOOD LUCK ! """)
